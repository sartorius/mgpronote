         * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.

         * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
         * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
         * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
         * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
